# Stream Gold Store on StreamPay


This repository is a POC for testing StreamPay / Solana Pay as well as the developer experience.
Nothing fancy, the code is not formatted, and just here to work quickly in a few hours of work.

## Project Description

Tokenization of Physical Gold.

### Asset-Backed Token

The Stream Protocol is about tokenizing the asset gold in which there is transparency as to the property rights and redemption of the 99% pure gold. Stream Token gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of Stream Gold NFTs, and physical bars. On the Stream Vault Platform, customers can convert their Stream tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk.
