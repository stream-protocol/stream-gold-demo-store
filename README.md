# Stream Gold Store on Stream Pay


This repository is a POC for testing Stream Pay / Solana Pay as well as the developer experience.
Nothing fancy, the code is not formatted, and just here to work quickly in a few hours of work.

## Project Description

Tokenization of Physical Gold.

### Asset-Backed Token

The Stream Protocol is about tokenizing the asset gold in which there is transparency as to the property rights and redemption of the Gold.
$GLD Token gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. On the Stream Vault Platform, customers can convert their Stream "$GLD" tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk.
